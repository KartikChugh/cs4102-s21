### NOTE: MODULE 1 Homeworks are ready to go! Gradescope is ready to accept submission for module 1 assignments as well.



<a name="introduction"></a>How to Submit Assignments
--------------------------------------- 

We will be using [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) for this course. Check out the [Gradescope Information Page](./gradescope.html) for information on how to submit programming assignments to Gradescope.

That page also explains how the score reported by Gradescope translates to the three-level scale of *Incomplete, Satisfied,* or *Mastered* that is used in this course.
